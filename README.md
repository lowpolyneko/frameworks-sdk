# Frameworks SDK Module Build Scripts

We have build scripts for compiling the Frameworks SDK using system available
modules and libraries.

## Build Environment

The build environment assumes a user session on
`{aurora,sunspot}.alcf.anl.gov`. Builds are performed in `/tmp`.

Prior to building, most build scripts will load common modules and environment
variables using the `setup_build_env` routine in `ci-lib.sh`.

## Adding a Build Script

Build scripts are generally structured similarly.

```sh
#!/bin/sh

source ../ci-lib.sh

# 1) Pull source and gen build environment
gen_build_dir_with_git 'https://github.com/<foo>/<bar>'
setup_build_env

setup_uv_venv # pass needed dependencies (i.e. from prior builds) here

# 2) Set <library> configuration
export CC="$(which gcc)"
export CXX="$(which g++)"

# 3) Build & Archive
build_bdist_wheel
archive_artifacts
```

## Wheels

We have scripts to build the following wheels:
- pytorch/
    - pytorch
    - ao[^disabled]
    - torchtune[^disabled]
- intel/
    - intel-extension-for-pytorch
    - torch-ccl
- mpi4py/mpi4py
- h5py/h5py[^disabled]

[^disabled]: not ran by CI pipeline

### Build Time(s)

|   &nbsp;   | took (hours) |
| :--------: | :----------: |
|  `torch`   |    ~ 2:00    |
|   `ipex`   |    ~ 1:00    |
| others[^1] |    < 0:30    |
| **total**  |    ~ 4:00    |


[^1]: Others:
    - `h5py/h5py` (broken ??)
    - `intel/torch-ccl`
    - `mpi4py/mpi4py`
